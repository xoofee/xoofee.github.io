## Overview

### Overview of "Counting Stars" by OneRepublic

"Counting Stars" is the lead single from OneRepublic's third studio album *Native* (2013). Written by frontman Ryan Tedder and produced by Tedder and Noel Zancanella, it became one of the band's biggest global hits—spending 68 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #2, and selling over 10 million copies worldwide.

Musically, it blends pop-rock with folk-pop and slight reggae influences (especially in the rhythmic guitar and off-beat accents). The song is built around an infectious acoustic-guitar riff, handclaps, and a huge, anthemic chorus.

### Lyrics Meaning & Interpretation

The core theme of "Counting Stars" is **rejecting the empty pursuit of money and materialism in favor of living for dreams, love, and meaning**—even if that means financial struggle.

#### Key lines and breakdown:

**Verse 1**  
*"Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep / Dreaming about the things that we could be"*  
Ryan is restless because he's chasing bigger dreams instead of settling for a safe, conventional life.

*"But baby I've been, I've been praying hard / Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars"*  
This is the central metaphor:  
- "Counting dollars" = obsessing over money, bills, status, materialism.  
- "Counting stars" = focusing on wonder, hope, love, dreams—things that are priceless and infinite.

**Pre-chorus**  
*"I feel something so right / Doing the wrong thing / And I feel something so wrong / Doing the right thing"*  
Society tells you the "right thing" is to get a stable job, save money, play it safe. But that feels soul-crushing ("wrong") to him. Conversely, chasing risky dreams and passion feels morally "wrong" by conventional standards, yet it feels deeply right inside.

*"I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie / Everything that kills me makes me feel alive"*  
Taking risks, even failing, is better than a numb, safe existence.

**Chorus**  
*"Take that money, watch it burn / Sink in the river the lessons I've learned"*  
He's willing to let money go (symbolically burn it) because he's learned that chasing it alone leads to emptiness.

**Verse 2**  
*"Hope is our four-letter word"*  
"Hope" is contrasted with typical four-letter curse words—hope is almost taboo or naïve in a cynical, money-driven world, but he's embracing it anyway.

*"Make that money, watch it burn"* (repeated)  
Rebellion against the system that equates net worth with self-worth.

**Bridge**  
*"Swing my heart across the line"*  
A reference to risking everything emotionally.  
*"In my face is flashing signs / Seek it out and ye shall find"*  
Biblical allusion ("Ask and it shall be given… seek and ye shall find" – Matthew 7:7). He's saying the answers are right in front of us if we look beyond money.

### Ryan Tedder's Own Explanation

In several interviews (e.g., with Billboard and VH1), Ryan Tedder has said the song was inspired by a period when he was broke despite having written massive hits for other artists. He felt the pressure to "make it" financially while realizing that many rich people he knew were miserable. He literally had a dream where he was counting stars instead of money, and woke up writing the chorus.

He also mentioned influences from traveling in places like Jamaica and hearing Bob Marley's philosophy of valuing life over wealth, which seeped into the song's vibe.

### Overall Message

"Counting Stars" is an anthem for anyone who has ever felt trapped by the rat race and dreamed of something bigger—even if it means being broke, taking risks, or looking foolish to others. It's ultimately optimistic: choosing meaning over money doesn't just feel better; it makes you feel alive.

That combination of catchy melody + relatable "screw the system, chase your soul" message is why the song exploded and still resonates over a decade later.

## MV

### Official Music Video for "Counting Stars" (2013) – Explained

Director: James Lees  
Released: May 31, 2013  
Length: 4:44  
Views: Over 4 billion on YouTube (one of the most-watched videos of all time)

#### Visual Concept in One Sentence
The music video is a surreal, symbolic rebellion against soulless religion and corporate conformity, set inside a single room that literally falls apart when people choose authentic passion over empty ritual.

#### Scene-by-Scene Breakdown & Symbolism

1. **Opening – The Fake Church Service (0:00–0:50)**  
   - We see a bland, fluorescent-lit basement "church" meeting.  
   - A preacher in a cheap suit is passionately preaching/singing into a microphone.  
   - People sit numbly in folding chairs, some mouthing words without emotion.  
   → This represents organized religion (or any institution) that has lost its soul and become routine and performative.

2. **Ryan Tedder in the Crocodile Pit (0:50–1:30)**  
   - Cut to Ryan lying on the floor of this same room, but now there's a huge hole in the floor revealing a live alligator/crocodile thrashing below him.  
   - He's literally inches from death, singing calmly.  
   → Symbol: When you reject the safe, fake system ("counting dollars"), you suddenly find yourself in danger, close to being "eaten" by the consequences (poverty, failure, judgment). But he's at peace with the risk.

3. **The Band Performs Under the Congregation**  
   - The rest of OneRepublic is playing the song directly beneath the floorboards the church people are standing on.  
   - You can see their silhouettes and lights through the cracks.  
   → Truth and real emotion are literally underneath the fake façade, trying to break through.

4. **The Floor Starts Breaking – People Fall Through (2:20 onward)**  
   - As the song builds, people in the meeting begin stomping and letting go.  
   - One by one they crash through the floor and land in the band's rehearsal space below.  
   - Some look terrified, some ecstatic.  
   → This is the moment of choosing to "fall" out of the safe but dead system and into real life, passion, and risk. It's scary but liberating.

5. **The Final Drop (3:50–end)**  
   - Even the preacher lets go, drops the microphone, and falls through the floor with everyone else.  
   - The entire room collapses; everyone ends up in the raw, underground space dancing and celebrating together while the crocodile still snaps below.  
   - Final shot: Ryan stands up calmly as the reptile lunges and the screen cuts to black.  
   → Complete surrender to the dangerous but authentic life. Money, status, and fake religion are destroyed; what's left is pure human connection and feeling alive.

#### Core Message of the Video
The video takes the song's lyric ("no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars") and makes it visual:  
The moment you stop playing the safe, materialistic, or religiously performative game, the fake world you were standing on collapses—and that's a good thing. You fall into something real, raw, and dangerous, but also freeing and full of life.

It's one of the rare music videos where the visuals perfectly match and even deepen the lyrical message, which is why it became iconic and racked up billions of views.

## Lyrics

```
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars"

I see this life like a swingin' vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashin' signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doin' what we're told

I feel somethin' so right doin' the wrong thing
And I feel somethin' so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars"

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars", yeah

I feel your love, and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
"Hope" is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doin' what we're told

And I feel somethin' so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me, makes me wanna fly

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
Baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars" (ooh, ooh)

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep (ooh, ooh)
Dreamin' about the things that we could be (ooh, ooh)
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard (ooh, ooh)
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars" (ooh, ooh)

Oh, take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
Baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars" (ooh, ooh)

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep (ooh, ooh)
